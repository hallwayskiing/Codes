 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle.
 * Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * <p>
 * Do not modify the linked list.
